This is ENIGMA, my first proprietary Python project.


WHAT YOU NEED TO RUN:

Python 3.10 or later

Python is available for Windows, Linux/UNIX and macOS, and can be downloaded at: https://www.python.org/downloads/



TO RUN:

Simply run "Enigma.py" and READ THE PROMPTS.



The idea came about as I was studying arrays and thought a 2-dimensional array/matrix looked like a board and that could be used to make a game.

I haven't studied game design, so the actual gameplay might be wonky, but it was a nice way for me to study... idk, everything so far. Classes, functions, arrays, modules... I might list all "competences" of the project here in the future.

It's all proprietary code. If I found something on Stack Overflow or used ChatGPT, I'd only use it here after I properly learned what the code does.

You can play by running Enigma.py, there's a makeshift (for now) tutorial and the game starts.

The most important information is that PLAYS WORK ON ENTIRE ROWS/COLUMNS. Just keep that in mind and the game (should) explain everything else.

Have fun!

(Please tell me if anything breaks)
